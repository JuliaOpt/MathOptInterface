# Index types

"""
    ConstraintIndex{F,S}

A type-safe wrapper for `Int64` for use in referencing `F`-in-`S` constraints in
a model.
The parameter `F` is the type of the function in the constraint, and the
parameter `S` is the type of set in the constraint. To allow for deletion,
indices need not be consecutive. Indices within a constraint type (i.e. `F`-in-`S`)
must be unique, but non-unique indices across different constraint types are allowed.
