# Index types

"""
    ConstraintIndex{F,S}

A type-safe wrapper for `Int64` for use in referencing `F`-in-`S` constraints in a model.
The parameter `F` is the type of the function in the constraint, and the parameter `S` is the type of set in the constraint.
To allow for deletion, indices need not be consecutive.
